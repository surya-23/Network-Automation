This assignment is to implement a simple web service. So that we have to create servers like devA, devB,devC, devhaproxy and Bastion. With the help of ansible playbook it installs nginx and php-fpm in servers devA, devB and devC to work more efficient.Then it setups nginx.conf file at etc/nginx and remove "default" site at etc/nginx/sites-enabled. Now it setups nginx.conf file at etc/nginx/sites-available.Then it links default etc/nginx/sites-available to etc/nginx/sites-enable.Then it setups index.php file at root var/www/html.Through ansible playbook it installs haproxy load balancer to distribute the load between the servers.Then it pushes haproxy configuration file haproxy.cfg.j2 to etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg.Now it setups default starting flag to 1 in etc/default/haproxy.And the bastion acts as jump host and provides secuity.
